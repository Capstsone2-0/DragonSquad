# AccountingLedger-Capstone1

## Project Overview

Accounting Ledger is a fully functional ledger website with a Spring Boot API backend and a CSV files database for data storage, and ReactJS/HTML/CSS for the front-end. 

Accounting Ledger allows users to efficiently manage and keep track of their financial transactions. It allows users to record deposits and payments, view a ledger of all the user's financial activities, and run various financial reports.
